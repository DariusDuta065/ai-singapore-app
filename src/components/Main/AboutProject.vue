          <p>
            AI Singapore (AISG) is a national AI programme launched by the
            National Research Foundation (NRF) to anchor deep national
            capabilities in Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on four key
            pillars; research, technology, innovation and makerspace.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project is being instructed by AISG to collate a dataset of
            videos to be used to train machine learning models to recognise
            specific activities.
